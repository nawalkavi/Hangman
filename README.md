___Background___ <br />
A Hangman game made using the Pygame library inside of Python! Includes two game modes, consisting of either the player guessing or the AI guessing the chosen word. <br />
Made as part of my A-Level Computer Science NEA. <br />

___Installation___ <br />
Ensure that Python 3.10 or later is installed on your system - https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.0/python-3.10.0-amd64.exe <br />
In the setup wizard, make sure to add Python to PATH. <br />
Download the .zip file from the project files and extract it into a folder of your choice. <br />
Open Terminal and run ```pip install pygame sys```, which will install the necessary Python libraries onto your system. <br />
Navigate to where the .zip file was extracted, click on the address bar and type in ```cmd```, which should open a Command Prompt window pointed to that specific location. <br />
Type in ```main.py``` and run it. The game will open in a new program window. <br />
